# CSC-174-Assignment-5
Repository for Assignment 5
Intended layout of each page from a high-level (think: wireframes and sketches) so the designer can execute the layout in CSS: We should have six tabs as follows home, cats, snakes and parrots, survey, login and register.
The home page will have our title Pets, a large backgorund picture representing the theme of pets and subsections on the three pets being investigated at the bottom with links to their respective pages.
The cats, snakes and parrots will have three sub headings and all three webpages should look virtually similar. An image of The pet in question would be placed under the tab and the three sub headings should follow so it looks uniform.
The login, survery and survey pages should be similar in design to the rest of the webpages and should sill reflect the naturalistic theme.

Intended mood/feeling of the website so the designer can execute the formatting including typeface choices, color choices and other embellishments: The topic of choice is pet so I would like to have fonts that have an animalistic feel to them, color choices should also reflect nature.

Intended interactivity (especially in regard to the survey, the login system, and the database functions) to be executed by the coder (keep in mind: you can’t ask the coder to do really complex things if they’re not capable of such things! - keep it realistic - talk to each other!): The survey will be a pet survey asking about the Pet choices of prospective Pet owner visitors to our wbesite. The login and register pages should be coded and make sure once the user is logged out they do not have access to the private area of the website.

For the Designer Albert Nissim,

However, you could change it as you desire.Change the backgound picture to something thats fit the main topic of Pets.Choose Fonts and pictures that go with the main topic of Pets.Make sure the design for the ,Survey Login and Register pages are similar to the rest of the other webpages.

For the Coder Fiyin Oluyinka,
Code the Survey page to collect details from visitors to our website. Use bluehost database.

Make sure once a user is logged out they do not have access to private area of the website.
