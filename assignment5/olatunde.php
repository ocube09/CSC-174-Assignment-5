	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I am Olatunde Oshunlaja. I know right pretty complex to pronounce so you can just call me "Ola". I am Junior who is majoring in Business and minoring in Computer Science.I Love traveling the world and experiencing new cultures. An interesting tidbit about me is that I have been to school in three different countries Nigeria, England and now the US. I speak two languages English and Yoruba. Some of my favorite books include” Extreme ownership” by Jocko Willink, “Tribe” by Sebastian Junger and “The Prince” by Niccolo Machiavelli and the play “Titus Andronicus” by William Shakespeare. My Favorite quote is by the baseball player Mickey Rivers which goes “ain’t no sense worryin’ about things you got control over, ‘cause if you got control over ‘em, aint no sense worryin’. And ain’t no sense worryin’ about the things you don’t got control over, ‘cause if you don’t got control over ‘em, ain’t no sense worryin’. My Philosophy on life is based on Guy Ritchie’s idea of owning the suit. It is an idea that you can construct your own narrative. What kind of messages with your suit do you want to convey to others.</p>

	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<p>I am huge fan of Sports. It’s the competition in sports that intrigues me the most.  There is something about watching individuals with some of the greatest talents on the planet dueling against each other that excites me. The sporting activities I have a keen interest include Mixed Martial Arts, Football, Basketball, Formula 1, Track (mostly 100m and 200m) and Soccer. However, Soccer is my one true love. I absolutely love playing and watching soccer. I’m a huge Manchester united Fan. Some of my favorite sportsmen include Lewis Hamilton, Paul Scholes, Rose Namajunas and Khabib Nurmagomedov</p>
